# Design Patterns

In this section, I'll add some notes & explanations about the design patterns in software engineering.

First let's discuss **What is a Design Pattern?**
> [!Important]
> _In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem
within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or
machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations._

- Efficient, reusable, and maintainable solutions to common software problems.
- It's like a blueprint for solving a certain type of problems, but it's not a specific set of instructions you can just
  copy.

> [!NOTE]
> **Pattern** has some similarities with **Algorithm**, but you can imagine it as a higher level of abstraction.

**There are 3 types of Design Patterns:**

1. **Creational Patterns:**
    - Related to object creation.
    - Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. **Structural Patterns:**
    - Related to object composition and relationships between classes.
    - They help to answer How to build a software component to be efficient and flexible.

3. **Behavioral Patterns:**
    - Related to communication between objects.
    - Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Here's some notes about each type:

2. [Structural Patterns](Structural/README.md)

3. [Behavioral Patterns](Behavioral/README.md)
